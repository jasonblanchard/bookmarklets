bookmarklets
============

A list of common bookmarklets that automate some in-browser tasks

Beware! These bookmarklets are for very specific tasks and will not work for anything other than the one thing I use them for! They also run arbitrary JavaScript on the current page, so make sure you know exactly what the code does before you run it.

However, these are useful syntax examples for selecting items on the page and simulating clicks.

INSTALLATION
===========
This particular HTML file was exported from Chrome and will import smoothly into it. The bookmarklets should also work in most browsers. To add one, create a new bookmark and copy the `HREF` source into the bookmark URL (it should start with `javascript:`).

When you select this bookmark, the JavaScript code will run on the current page.
