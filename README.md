bookmarklets
============

A list of common bookmarklets that automate some in-browser tasks

Beware! These bookmarklets are for very specific tasks and will not work for anything other than the one thing I use them for! They also run arbitrary JavaScript on the current page, so make sure you know exactly what the code does before you run it.

However, these are useful syntax examples for selecting items on the page and simulating clicks.
